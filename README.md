# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator

A Python-based Image Caption Generator that utilizes deep learning models to automatically describe the contents of an image with natural language. This project combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for caption generation.

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts image features using pretrained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3).
- Generates grammatically correct image captions using LSTM-based RNN.
- End-to-end deep learning pipeline from image preprocessing to caption generation.
- Easy-to-use and modular codebase for training and inference.
